<h3 id="section5">Types of Performance Appraisal in HRM</h3>

<p>Most of&nbsp;the organization&#39;s supervisors are in charge of performance appraisal. However, there are different types of employee performance appraisal in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/human-resource/human-resource-management.html" title="HRM">HRM</a>&nbsp;based on the people who evaluate the performance of the employee.</p>

<p>The four major types of performance appraisal are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Self-assessment: Here the employee themselves rate their job performance&nbsp;and work behavior</li>
	<li>Peer assessment: Under this assessment, the team members, co-workers, and workgroup are responsible for the performance rating of the employee.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>360-degree performance appraisal: In this type of appraisal the performance rating is collected from the employee, their immediate supervisor, and peers.</li>
	<li>Negotiated appraisal: In order to avoid the conflicts between employee and their supervisors a new trend of appraisal is utilized. In this type of performance appraisal, a mediator evaluates the performance of the employee and puts focus on the good side of performance rather than the criticism.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="section6">Methods of Employee Performance Appraisal?</h3>

<p>Employee performance appraisal has two types of methods namely traditional methods and modern methods used by various organizations. The traditional methods are quite simple and quick to execute while the modern methods are more focused on covering the overall well-being of the organization.</p>

<p><strong>Traditional Methods of Employee Performance Appraisal</strong></p>

<p>Here is a list of different traditional methods which can be used for employee performance appraisal:</p>

<p><strong>Rating Scales:</strong>&nbsp;In this scale, the factors such as attitude, initiative, dependability, etc are quantified. A range of excellent to poor is provided to the rater and based on the rating the performance of the employee is calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong>&nbsp;A checklist form of performance appraisal consist of a column of &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;No&rsquo; for different employee traits. The rater has to put a tick mark based on if the traits exist or do not exist in the employee.</p>

<p><strong>Forced Choice Method</strong>: In this method, different statements about the performance of the employee are provided to the rater and he/she is forced to answer the ready-made statements as true or false. Further evaluation of performance is carried on by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/human-resource.html" title="Human Resource">Human Resource</a>&nbsp;department based on the answers of the rater.</p>

<p><strong>Forced Distribution Method</strong>:&nbsp;In this method, it is assumed that the performance of an employee conforms to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/performance-management/bell-curve-appraisal.html" title="bell-shaped curve">bell-shaped curve</a>. Thus, the rater has to put employees on provided points on the scale.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Incidents Method</strong>:&nbsp;Here the critical behavior of the employee is considered by the supervisor while evaluating the performance.</p>

<p><strong>Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale</strong>:&nbsp;Different statements which are descriptive in nature are prepared about the behavior of the employee. These behaviors are put on the scale points and the rater has to indicate the points which explain the employee behavior in a more exact way.</p>

<p><strong>Field Review Method</strong>: In this method, the reviewer of the performance is generally someone outside the department. The people from the HR department or corporate office do the performance evaluation of the employee based on the records and interviews.</p>

<p><strong>Performance Tests and Observations</strong>: This is a kind of oral test that is conducted to test the skills and knowledge of the employees in their respective fields. The employees sometimes receive a situation and are asked to demonstrate their skills and then their performance is evaluated based on that presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Confidential Reports</strong>: Often the government departments follow this method of performance evaluation. The employees are evaluated based on the parameters such as leadership quality, teamwork, integrity, technical ability, attendance, etc. The reviewer sends the confidential review to the concerned authority about the performance of the employee.</p>

<p><strong>Essay Method:</strong>&nbsp;Under this method, the detailed description of the employee performance is written by the rater. The performance of an employee, his relations with other Co-workers, requirements of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/training-development.html" title="training and development">training and development</a>&nbsp;programs, strengths and weaknesses of the employee etc. are some of the points that are included in the essay. The efficiency of this traditional method of performance appraisal depends on the writing skills of the rater.</p>

<p><strong>Cost Accounting Method</strong>: It is a simple method in which the performance of the employee is linked with the monetary benefits of the organization. The rater checks about the cost to the company to keep the employee and the contribution of the employee in terms of monetary business.</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Evaluation Approaches</strong>: This approach includes a comparison of the performance of co-workers with each other. It is of two types namely the ranking method and paired comparison method. It is a quite popular method of employee performance appraisal in the corporate world.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Methods of Employee Performance Appraisal</strong></p>

<p>Here is a list of different modern methods which can be used for employee performance appraisal:</p>

<p><strong>Management by Objectives</strong>:&nbsp;In this method, the performance of the employee is assessed based on the targets achieved by him/her. The management at the beginning of the financial year conveys the set goals to the employees, at the end of the year the performance of the employee is compared with the set goals and evaluated for the appraisal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Psychological Appraisals</strong>:&nbsp;Psychologists are invited to the companies for the performance appraisal of the employees. Here the performance is in the context of the potential future performance. Psychological tests, in-depth interviews, reviews, and discussions with the managers are the methods used for the evaluation of the performance.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment Centers</strong>:&nbsp;A series of exercises are conducted at the assessment center of the company to actually evaluate the performance of the employee. The exercises include discussions, role-playing, computer simulations, and many more. The employees are evaluated in terms of communication skills, mental alertness, emotional intelligence, confidence, and administrative abilities. The rater observes the event and evaluates the performance of the employee at the end.</p>

<p><strong>360-Degree Feedback</strong>: It is particularly a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/performance-management/360-degree-performance-appraisal.html" title="360-degree feedback">360-degree feedback</a>&nbsp;method in which the information about the performance of the employee is collected from supervisors, peers, group members, and self-assessment. All the remarks are considered to evaluate the overall work performance of the employee.</p>

<p><strong>720-Degree Feedback</strong>: In line with the 360-Degree feedback system, here the feedback is collected from the stakeholders within the company as well as the people linked from outside the organization. The customers, suppliers, investors, and other financial groups provide feedback about the performance of the employee.</p>

<h3 id="section7">Performance Appraisal Objectives</h3>

<p>The main objective of the employee performance appraisal is often termed as a comparison of the standard performance set by the organization with the actual performance of the employee.

</ul>

<h3 id="section8">Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Performance Appraisal</h3>

</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of Performance Appraisal</strong></p>

<ul>

	<li>Sometimes the vital factors responsible for the performance are ignored during performance appraisal.</li>
	<li>The factors like attitude, abilities, and initiative are very vague and difficult to gauge.</li>
	<li>Sometimes the managers who carry out the performance appraisal are not qualified enough to properly assess the abilities of the employees. Thus, it leads to irrelevant data collection and failure of performance appraisal.</li>
</ul>
