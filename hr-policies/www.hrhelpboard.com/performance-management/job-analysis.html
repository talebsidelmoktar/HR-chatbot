<h3 id="section7">How to Conduct Job analysis?</h3>

<p>The answer to how to conduct a job analysis is not an easy one. There are various aspects that are involved while the HR department conducts the job analysis.</p>

<p>Here are the six important aspects which has to be utilized while conducting job analysis :</p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Source of data</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" xss="removed">The source of data is the person or agency which provides information about the ground reality of the job. It includes the job analyst, employees who have experience in performing such jobs, and supervisors who can convey the need of the job.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Method of collecting data</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" xss="removed">It is difficult to collect all the information about the job without using any tools. Thus one should conduct interviews with employees and supervisors; a questionnaire can be distributed to get exact information about the job. Other information gathering methods include the records of the organization and observation by the agents or managers.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Job data</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" xss="removed">The collected job data should include information related to jobs such as tasks, performance, standards, responsibilities, the knowledge required, skills required, experience needed, job context, equipment used and duties of job holder.</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Job specification</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" xss="removed">The job data is then divided into job specification which includes skill requirement, physical demands, knowledge requirement, and abilities needed</p>

<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Job description</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" xss="removed">The job description is a collection of information about the tasks, duties, and responsibilities of the job holder.</p>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp;Functions of the HR Department</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" xss="removed">Once the job description and specification are properly defined the information is used to carry out different HR functions such as <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/recruitment.html" title="recruitment">recruitment</a>, selection, training and development, performance appraisal, and compensation management.</p>

<h3 id="section8">Job Analysis Methods</h3>

<p>Organizations have several methods and techniques to conduct a job analysis. Although the process of job analysis remains the same, the methods used to collect the data differ from organization to organization.</p>

<p>Here are some authentic job analysis methods to collect the data which is further used for conducting job analysis:</p>

<p><strong>Personal observation</strong></p>

<p>In this method, an observer is appointed by the organization to keep a watch on the individuals performing the job. The observer then creates an extensive list of tasks performed and the qualities of the individual which are utilized when executing the task. This method is useful but it does not work under certain conditions. The task executed might be different every day and thus it is difficult to draw a conclusion based on a few days of personal observation.</p>

<p><strong>The actual execution of the job</strong></p>

<p>The job analyzer can actually perform the job to get information about the skill requirement, difficulty while performing the job, and efforts required to finish the given task.</p>

<p><strong>Interview method</strong></p>

<p>The information is collected about the job with the help of interviews with employees and their supervisors. The questions related to the skill level required, the task, and the preparations needed to perform the job are asked during the interview. Although it is a time-consuming technique it works well to gather information about the job. However many time both employee and supervisor forget to mention certain aspects of the job. Many times the job responsibilities are exaggerated and thus make it difficult to define the job description and specification.</p>

<p><strong>Questionnaires method</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the least costly methods which can be used to collect data for job analysis. A well-designed and easy to understanding questionnaires can be very useful to collect information regarding a job in a short period of time. Multiple choice questions, as well as open-ended questions, can be designed to understand the views of employees towards their job. The only drawback of this method is more number of incomplete forms and inaccurate information given by the employees about their job profile can lead to failure of job analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Log records and HR records</strong></p>

<p>The log record book created by the employee about their daily activities in the office is a very useful type of job data. The records are extensive in nature and thus provide fair idea regarding the responsibilities and duties linked to the job. In a similar way, the HR record can also be used as job data. It has information regarding the core competency of the employees, their experience history, and promotions received. It also has employees&rsquo; personal information such as educational qualifications, previous job profile and job title, and the year of experience.</p>

<p><strong>Computerized Job Analysis</strong></p>

<p>With the help of information communication technology, computerized job analysis systems are developed by researchers. The specificity of data is a significant attribute of computerized job Analysis. A job analysis database is created by compiling all the specific data together. It takes less effort and time to write job descriptions using a computerized job analysis system. The job descriptions created using this method are quite accurate and linked with the compensation system.</p>

<p>Apart from these methods few companies also use the critical incident method in which the employee list out their experiences of critical incidents while performing the job. Combination methods are also used sometimes to get quick and accurate results.</p>
