<h3 id="section9">How to write a good Job description?</h3>
</section>

<section id="How">
<p xss="removed">Writing a job description is not easy task. There are several points in JD which one should keep in mind while creating a job description. Appropriateness and relevance is key answer of the question how to write job description. Here are certain things to be taken care at the time of writing a job description:</p>

<p><strong>1. Choose a correct job title</strong></p>

<p xss="removed">Job title often reflects the position of the employee as well as the responsibilities they are supposed to handle. The rule of ARM should be followed while selecting the job title.</p>

<p>ARM stands for Accurate, Realistic and Meaningful. It is observed that to attract the candidates many hiring managers keep the non-traditional job titles such as Unicorn Designer or Rockstar Manager. These kind of job titles are misleading and thus should be avoided. The accuracy of job title refers to the highlight of &lsquo;role&rsquo; the employee has to perform. For example- title &lsquo;manager&rsquo; indicates a team to be managed while &lsquo;executive&rsquo; defines the strategic roles. The realistic job titles are easily captured in the job search and thus relevant candidates are likely to apply to the job. Lastly the meaningfulness of the title is about the business word which is linked with the job. For example- Business development is a right word for a sales position rather than dynamic markets administrator.</p>

<p><strong>2. Use of Simple and Clear Language</strong></p>

<p>The job descriptions should be easy to understand and should not have any jargons. Many difficult to understand or rarely used phrases turn off the candidates. Thus, job descriptions should be clear, accurate and simple in nature.</p>

<p><strong>3. Tasks and Responsibilities should be elaborated</strong></p>

<p>The Jobseeker who are on <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/jobs-online/job-search.html" title="job search">job search</a> and fit in your requirement, take those candidates for a small run of typical day at work through the job description. In short include the daily tasks and the responsibilities in a specific manner. Using bullet points really helps here to add clarity in the description.</p>

<p><strong>4. Information about the company</strong></p>

<p>Provide the glimpse of the organizational culture to the employee. You can include the testimonials of your current employees. Introduce your company to the candidate; add information such as mission of the company, product and services, along with the market status. To attract the right candidate, it is always good to add information about technology is which the organization works, key clients (if not confidential), and latest achievement of the company.</p>

<p><strong>5. Job Related Skills should be Highlighted</strong></p>

<p>It is essential to describe the skills which are required to perform the particular job. The qualifications related to the skills such as certifications should be clearly mentioned in the job description. The <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/performance-management/job-specification.html" title="job specification">job specification</a> which highlight the abilities which are the key requirement to perform the job, have to be conveyed to the candidates such as- need to work on deadlines or excellent verbal communication is required. The discriminatory language should be avoided while mentioning the skills. The sentences such as &lsquo;youthful salesmen or attractive women candidate&rsquo; should be avoided.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. Convey the Compensation and Benefits clearly</strong></p>

<p>It is very much in the favor of the company to clearly specify the compensation. The perks and benefits of the job such as bonuses, learning opportunities, healthcare programs, and insurances help to attract candidates towards the job.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned points help to create a good job description or JD. However, there are certain points which should be avoided while writing a job description. The points include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Asking for way too much</strong>- The job should be realistically performable. It should not include an exaggeration and one man show kind of tasks.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Mysterious profile</strong>- The lack of clarity and too much suspense makes it difficult for the candidates to actually understand what kind of job they are going to perform. Thus, mystery in job description should be avoided.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Negativity</strong>- Excluding people in brutal way. For Example- people below 5-year experience are not eligible for the profile. Instead of the negative words, you can use sentences like- this senior level job needs experience above 5 years.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
