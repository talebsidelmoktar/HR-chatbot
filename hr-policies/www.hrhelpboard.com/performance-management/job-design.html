<div><img alt="Job Design Steps" src="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/uploaded_files/userfiles/images/job-design-steps.webp" xss="removed" /></div>

<p><strong>Job information</strong></p>

<p xss="removed">HR needs to have the information about the job being performed by the employee; it not only helps in the evaluation of the compensation design for an employee but also gives the role clarity. Information that is not true may lead to disparities between the plan and its execution and then the evaluation. So it is important to have the proper documentation work about the role and duties be done on time and should be communicated properly to the employees. What all information to have:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Specific tasks, areas of responsibility, and examples of work being carried out</p>

	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Job analysis</strong></p>

<p>The next is to analyze all the information collected and the HR has to pick out the imperative and important aspect of the job that is required to be done and the responsibilities that are to be carried out in the job. For HR doing the <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/performance-management/job-analysis.html" title="Job analysis"><strong>Job analysis</strong></a>, it is better for them to have a line manager specific to that domain to be a part of the process for better accuracy. Not only do the duties and responsibilities of the job have to be kept in mind but HR also needs to see how the employees are feeling about the job, this can be done through a <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/recruitment/articles/15-basic-job-interview-questions-and-answers-99.html" title="direct interview"><strong>direct interview</strong></a> or through circulating a questionnaire so that the job design can be planned accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Develop the job design plan for the employee</strong></p>

<p>On the basis of the information analyzed about the job and about how the employee feels about his/her job. To check, if there is any sign of discomfort or dissatisfaction regarding their job. When you have evaluated this information, you need to see which method of job design you have to apply for the employee. There are various job design methods which are explained below in this article.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>

<p>After deciding on the job design method to be rolled out, <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/human-resource.html" title="HR">HR</a> needs to implement it in a successful way, where the goal of the individual and the company are in alignment. And you also need to guide the employee at every step about their role and responsibilities and why it will be beneficial for them to carry out the action for a particular job design method.</p>

<h3>Job Design Method &amp; Techniques</h3>

<p>There are broadly 4 types of Job Design methods and techniques that are used to bring some change in the job structure for an employee. Find below these methods and techniques of job design:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Job Rotation</strong></li>
</ol>

<p xss="removed"><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/hr-policies/job-rotation-policy.html" title="Job rotation"><strong>Job rotation</strong></a> is the lateral shift of the job role or positions, it happens between the job levels, and it cannot be mistakenly considered a promotion. As it does not help the person to move up the ladder of his/her career. It is done on a temporary basis where employees are moved back to their previous job after a stipulated time. It has many benefits like:</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Learning</strong>: When the employees are getting the opportunity to carry out a new role, they will definitely get to learn one or the other thing. It becomes a great way to transfer, knowledge skills, and competencies that lead to human capital accumulation.</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Flexibility</strong>: In a situation where there are more employees involved in job responsibility, then employees get more flexibility in performing the job role.</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Employee replacement</strong>: - This technique saves the organization from the loss that it would be born when any of the employees suddenly leaves. Rotating employees in that role can help the organization for an immediate period. Here, the job rotation method becomes the savior.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="2"><strong>Job Enlargement</strong></li>
</ol>

<p xss="removed">Job enlargement as the name suggests is about adding more responsibilities or activities in the same job to the employee. This means that employees will do different activities in the job that eliminates the boredom that the employee was going through, and it also eliminated the monotonous work of the employee. The benefits that the employee and the organization can yield from job enlargement are:</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Earn a higher wage</strong>: - Employees can earn higher wages after getting more responsibilities added to their role.</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Give more autonomy</strong>: - Along with autonomy comes accountability and responsibility. As the person is now handling more responsibility, they are given autonomy to do their job and they are more accountable for the result that they are extracting.</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Career growth:</strong> - When additional responsibility is given to the employees, they are also given the training so that they carry out the duties successfully. This helps the employee in learning new skills that can help in their further career. When employees realize that the organization is considering their individual growth, then there is less attrition rate in the country leading to the benefit of the organization.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="3"><strong>Job Enrichment</strong></li>
</ol>

<p xss="removed">This is the method where the motivators are added to the existing job. Like adding skill variety, extra tasks, giving feedback, meaning to the job, and increasing autonomy. Through this method, the job is made more meaningful for the employee.</p>

<p xss="removed">If you are getting confused between job enlargement and job enrichment here is the difference: job enlargement makes the job more motivating by broadening the job of the employees, whereas job enrichment is when we are adding motivators to the existing job of the employee.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits for job enrichment are:</strong></p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Increase satisfaction</strong>:&nbsp; when the meaning of the job is enhanced then the employee is more satisfied with the job. As the intensity and scope of the work have been increased, employees feel happier with the job.</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Better psychological states</strong>:&nbsp; It leads to increased meaningfulness for the work which leads to high-quality results from the employee. And increased employee experience.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="4"><strong>Job Simplification</strong></li>
</ol>

<p xss="removed">It is the process where a few tasks are removed from the job to make the job more focused on the main job. The aim behind this method is to initiate improved work methods that can maximize the output along with minimizing expenses and costs.</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Obviating unnecessary work</strong>: as we studied earlier that 34 % of the employees said they wasted time because of long hours. These long hours are taken by work that is unnecessary and that does not fetch any output or profit. Hence, removing such work will help the employee do the important required work</p>

<p xss="removed"><strong>Make employee more focused:</strong> when the extra work is removed employee is left with important and output-driven work, which brings more profit and minimizes the cost of the employee.</p>

<p xss="removed">Till now you have got a lot of information about job design, what is job design definition, what are the steps to plan job design, and what are the methods of job design. This information is imperative for not only Human Resource professionals but for every working professional, as it is planned for them, they should know why is it being done or what is the benefit of Job design.</p>

<h3>Importance and Benefits of Job design</h3>

<p>Job design is an important and crucial part of <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/human-resource/human-resource-management.html" title="human resource management"><strong>human resource management</strong></a>. It has a direct impact on the productivity and efficiency of the organization. It also contributes significantly to the enhancement of working conditions.</p>

<div><img alt="Benefits of Job Design" src="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/uploaded_files/userfiles/images/benefits-of-job-design.webp" xss="removed" /></div>

<p>It creates the tasks that must be completed in order for the project to be completed effectively. Job design yields many benefits for the organization as a whole and on an individual level as well:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Increased job satisfaction</strong>: Job design is an imperative part of the organization&#39;s operation, as it helps the HR department to reduce the negative component of the employees, work-life.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Eliminate on-the-job fatigue</strong>: It helps in reducing job dissatisfaction, which comes out as a result of the monotonous role of the employee, reducing the on-the-job fatigue that the employee is going through.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Improve the quality of work</strong>: when all the negative factors of the job are removed, the organization has the chance to get the optimum level of output from employees.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Provide meaning to work:</strong> job design methods are planned such that employees get more meaning from the job they are doing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Provide challenging work</strong>: When an employee is given more responsibility or a different task rather than a monotonous task then they have more challenges to overcome in their job which keeps their motivation level up.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Increased output and decreased cost</strong>: - the optimum level of output s received from the employee and as attrition and all the negative aspect are removed, the organization incurs less cost.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Decrease attrition rate:</strong> Both these components can lead to an increased attrition rate. So, with the help of job design attrition rate in the company is also handled. The high attrition rate in any organization is an alarming state for the HR department that needs to be taken care of on an immediate basis.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;Job design stops this acceleration of the situation by giving the employees some change in their monotonous job. Research is done by salary.com suggests the reason, why employees waste their time, the research also suggests that:</p>

<ol xss="removed">
	<li>
	<p>39% of the respondents in the survey spend just one hour a week or even less on non-work-related stuff.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>29 % of the respondents spend 2 hours a week on the computer at work.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>21 percent of the respondents, waste up to 5 hours a week</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>And at last, only 3 percent of the respondents spend 10 hours a week on their personal tasks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Reasons for the respondents to waste their time were:</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>35 % of employees reported that they waste time because they no longer find their job challenging</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>34 % of employees report that they wasted time due to the hours which are too long</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>32 % of the employees said that their company did not provide an incentive to them even if they work hard.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>30% are the employees that are unsatisfied with their job</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>23% of the employees said that they are bored with their job now</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>With these figures, you have got the picture of why job design is imperative and should be carried out carefully and successfully.</p>

<h3>Use of Abraham Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs in Job Design</h3>

<p>Intrinsic motivation or extrinsic motivation is imperative for an employee&rsquo;s productivity. When the Motivation level goes down you will see the quality of the work yielded by an employee is not up to the mark. A job design plan brings the motivation level of employees back to the place. Everybody is familiar with Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs which has two versions one which is dedicated to a layman and the other includes the stages of needs for an employee. These needs are the motivating factor for an employee to work. Job design should be made after identifying the current need of the employee and then planning job design in such a way that the employee moves up the ladder of Abraham <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs" title="Maslow &amp; hierarchy"><strong>Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy</strong></a> of needs.</p>

<h3>Abraham Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of need:</h3>

<div><img alt="Maslow Job Design" src="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/uploaded_files/userfiles/images/maslow-job-design.webp" xss="removed" /></div>

<p>For Example: If you identify that the employee is on the second stage, that is, on the safety and security needs then the employee is looking for a more secure and stable role in the organization. You will need to plan a job design method that is not very deviant from the current role to make the employee believe that organization is looking for a long-term relationship with her/him like Job Enlargement and Job Enrichment.</p>

<p>To better understand this theory of motivation, <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/human-resource.html" title="human resource"><strong>human resource</strong></a> needs to understand the job characteristics and link the two in an aligned manner to have a job design plan which is successful for a longer duration.</p>

<p xss="removed">&nbsp;<a href="https://fapedia.blogspot.com/2013/12/job-characteristics-theory.html" title="Source"><strong>Source</strong></a></p>

<p>HR can also communicate these elements to managers and employees so that they can work on an individual level.</p>

<h3>Job Design for Employers</h3>

<p>The Research claims that the way a job is done has an impact on an employee&#39;s confidence attitude, self-belief, and emotions. It directly links with <a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/home/ask/what-is-motivation-for-improving-employee-engagement.html" title="employee motivation"><strong>employee motivation</strong></a>, work performance, job happiness, phycological and mental wellness, and illness, absence or leaves are among them.</p>

<p>A Poorly designed job may cause losses and become expensive to an organization because it enhances the time period for employees to master skills and new systems or necessitates the <strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/jobs-online/job-search.html" title="hiring">hiring</a></strong> of more experienced and trained employees.</p>

<h3>Tips for Job Design</h3>
