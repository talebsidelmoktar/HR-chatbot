<div xss="removed">
<h3>360 Degree Performance Appraisal Process&nbsp;</h3>

<p><span xss="removed">The steps of the 360-degree feedback process may slightly vary from organization to organization. However, the schedule of the 360-degree feedback process remains quite the same. A timeline has been identified for a 360-degree performance review which includes different steps which the organization has to follow. The step starts with the communication about the 360-degree performance&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/performance-management/performance-appraisal-failure.html" title="appraisal"><span xss="removed"><strong>appraisal</strong>l</span></a><span xss="removed">&nbsp;method and it ends with the re-evaluation of participants.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">1. <strong>Communicating the 360-degree performance review-</strong> It is very crucial to communicate the entire process to the stakeholders of the organization. The purpose and objective of the 360-degree performance appraisal process should be clearly mentioned and explained to each and every participant. Also, the process through which the feedback will be gathered and how the feedback will be utilized should be clearly conveyed to the stakeholders.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- This process could take 2-3 weeks to communicate about the appraisal system. This can be done through a personal meeting with supervisors, managers, leaders, and employees. Also, it can be communicated through emails and employees should be encouraged to come forward if they have any queries related to the 360-degree performance appraisal process.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">2. <strong>Selection of raters</strong>-&nbsp;The selection of rater is one of the most important steps in a 360-degree performance appraisal system. We have to choose enough participants in order to receive data that is relevant and comprehensive. The number of raters will depend on the employee&rsquo;s job profile and working relationship.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- This process generally takes one to two weeks. The rater will include supervisors, direct reports, peers, and perhaps some customers or clients.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">3. <strong>Distribution of survey</strong>-&nbsp;Organizations can use an online 360-degree feedback system which will allow a quicker distribution of questionnaires among the employees. The participants will receive an email with the link of the questionnaire&nbsp;and notification. They can click on the link, and start and complete the 360 degree review.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- This may take one week in order to distribute the survey among all the employees.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">4. <strong>Submission of the questionnaire</strong>-&nbsp;Once the survey is distributed, the participant will complete the survey online. The completed review will be provided to the evaluator. This process can take the longest time. The time required to submit a questionnaire depends on the number of raters which are involved, the job profile of employees, and the organization. It is highly recommended that a particular deadline should be assigned to the participant in order to quickly finish the process.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- This process should take to 2-4 weeks in order to get completed feedback from the participant.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">5. <strong>Completion of the report</strong>-&nbsp;Once the review is been collected through the questionnaire method a confidential report is being produced. It depends on the delivery plan of the organization sometimes once the report is ready it is directly sent to the participants or the result is been given through one-one feedback session.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- if you are using an online system this very quick to produce the report, sometimes it takes 1 to 2 days.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">6. <strong>Facilitation of feedback</strong>-&nbsp;It is recommended that the feedback should be given in a confidential manner by arranging a meeting with the employee&rsquo;s manager or coach. This meeting will allow a great understanding of the feedback report and also provides an opportunity to discuss the strength of the employee and areas which need to be improved.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- It depends on the in-depth of the feedback session generally a meeting can last for 1 to 2 hours for each employee.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">7. <strong>Completion of development plan</strong>-&nbsp;Once the review is done the development plan should be created for each of the participants based on the feedback reviews received through 360-degree evaluation.&nbsp;It is important to develop an actionable plan which will help to improve the employee. The areas where the improvement is required should be identified as key areas based on which <strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/training-development/training-programme-evaluation.html" title="training programs">training programs</a></strong>, workshops, coaching, conferences, or mentoring should be arranged for the employee. The development of such a plan helps employees to improve quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- Generally, completion of the development program could take one to two weeks</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">8. <strong>Re-evaluating</strong>-&nbsp;360-degree feedback system is not one of the events; once you start the process it is important to see the consequences of the process. Specific goals and opportunities are outlined in the development program; it does make sense to check the progress. The re-evaluation of the participant will enable the organization to see the changes and the area in which the employees are actually improved.</span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">Time required- This process should be carried out after 8 to 12 months of 360-degree performance appraisal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
