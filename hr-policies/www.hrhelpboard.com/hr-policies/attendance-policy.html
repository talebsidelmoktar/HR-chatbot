<h1>Employee Time and Attendance Policy&nbsp; and Procedure in realtime</h1>

<hr />
<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><strong>Introduction of attendance policy:&nbsp;</strong>Attendance policy template is needed in an organisation when the employee frequent absence and tardiness is causing disturbance in the business.&nbsp; With enlarged company in order to deal with employees issues, time and attendance policy is needed. In some companies absenteeism and tardiness is considered as two different things but in other companies these 2 terms are used interchangeably.</span></span></span></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/uploaded_files/userfiles/images/Attendance Policy(3).jpg" xss="removed" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">Effective working in any organisation depends upon punctuality, sincerity and regular working of the employees and to a certain extent on employee attendance. In order to ensure regular working it is necessary to lay down rules and regulations which are followed within the organisation to maintain regularity. These rules and regulations can be framed under attendance policy. Each employee in the organisation is valued and is unique members who are encouraged to give their best productivity by being regular and punctual. So they are expected tofollow employee attendance policy and procedure regularly.</span></span></span></p>

<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">Absence of work for an employee can be authorised or unauthorised. Authorised absence is an absence from organisation for a genuine reason for e.g. Illness etc. Unauthorised absence may be defined as absence which are non reasonable and non acceptable. For e.g. Non- medical appointments and day off for birthday celebrations. These definitions are defined under employee attendance policy and procedure.</span></span></span></p>

<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">&nbsp;In order to ensure attendance is in line with the organisation time and attendance policy regular review and&nbsp;</span><u><strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/performance-management/evaluation-procedure.html" title="evaluation of data"><span xss="removed">evaluation of data</span></a></strong></u><span xss="removed"> is being done. The main aim of having work attendance policy is to provide supportive and inclusive working environment which encourage all employees to manage their health and well being. Work attendance policy gives a way to have regular updating of time off and total number of hours worked. It must be known to a manager that when employee is working, how much an employee is working. Managing an attendance procedure is important not only from data collection point of view but it helps an organisation to know what trends to follow to give time off to employees, what are the need of employees etc. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">Work attendance policy also points out on the productivity per employee. What&rsquo;s the time in and time out from work for an employee and how does an employee work within those hours which give clarity on per employee productivity. The grey areas are also highlighted when we study attendance and time data. For instance we get to know which employee has reached saturation and is completely exhausted and need a break. Similarly, we know which employee is least productive. We get to know about the concept of presenters also through Employee attendance data. Presenters are a theory in which employee report to work distracted and unable to carry out the duty rightly.</span></span></span></p>
