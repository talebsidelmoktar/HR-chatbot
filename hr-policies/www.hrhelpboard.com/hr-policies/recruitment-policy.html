<h2>What is recruitment policy in HRM?</h2>

<p>Recruitment may be defined as the process of attracting the right talent with the right skills, the right attitude, and the right experience. It is one of the very important and most discussed topics of human resources. Recruitment nowhere is used alone. It includes various terms with it, those terms are selection and induction. As per <strong><u><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/category/recruitment.html" title="recruitment and selection">recruitment and selection</a></u></strong>policy, the process of talent acquisition starts from recruitment and is processed further with selection and continues till induction. We can explain the term selection as well as induction. Selection is the process of choosing the best person for a given position. Recruitment is attraction and selection is to choose. Induction means introducing the person to the position. In other words, we can say the success of the company is based on the right recruitment to a very large extent as the process of recruitment is based on proper strategies.</p>

<p>An organization to survive well must have a concise Recruitment and Selection Policy so that it can have the best talent from a pool of candidates. Having a robust recruitment policy is the first demand of an efficient hiring process. The company must follow the recruitment policy and procedure.</p>

<h2>What all is needed to create a robust recruitment policy in HRM:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Clarity on a strategy to be employed for the implementation of recruitment and hiring policy.</li>
	<li>The recruitment policy must be a nonbiased policy.</li>
	<li>Clear cut guidelines to be followed for recruitment, selection, and induction i.e. Hiring Policy.</li>
	<li>All stakeholders must have defined responsibilities following recruitment policy and procedure.</li>
	<li>Stress should be on recruiting the right talent as mentioned under the recruitment and selection policy.</li>
	<li>Entire recruitment selection and induction must be based purely on merit.</li>

	<h3>Guidelines for an Interview</h3>

	<p>1. Basic purpose of an interview is to give and get information that helps in making a decision whether a candidate is suitable or not.<br />
	2. Every individual has their own interviewing style however there are certain parameters that need to be followed while conducting an interview.</p>

	<h3>Steps for conducting an interview:</h3>

	<p>1. Screen the resume well before the interview starts and it will help and make a manager feel more confident and comfortable.&nbsp;<br />
	2. Review the resume to check if it meets the following requirements:<br />
	<strong>a)</strong>Basic qualification needed to carry out the job.<br />
	<strong>b)</strong>Total work experience along with specialization in a given area.br /&gt; <strong>c)</strong>Skills that are needed to perform a given job and also to check if the candidate possesses some extra skills which can also be required for the given position.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>3. Make the environment friendly and comfortable. The candidate must feel the ease in conversation.<br />
	4. The interviewer must not get distracted; the interviewer must keep control over the interview so that meaningful discussion happens.<br />
	5. Try getting the relevant information by putting in questions that compel candidates to answer all that managers need to know.<br />
	6. Interview must not be a generic discussion session where a candidate is sharing only what he/she wants to share instead they must share what the interviewer wants to know.<br />
	7. Communication during the interview session must be smooth. All the barriers while answering the question must be removed.<br />
	8. The interviewer must try getting all relevant questions answered and all related topics must be covered.<br />
	9. If any aspect is still not clear the interviewer should ask the question again by rephrasing it or it can also be done by returning to it in the latter part of the interview session so that clarity is obtained on that particular aspect.<br />
	10.&nbsp; Well prepare the stage.<br />
	11. Interview must be conducted in a meeting room.<br />
	12.&nbsp; There should not be any disruptions due to mobile, laptop, etc.<br />
	13. It is generally preferred to have a round table discussion with the candidate so that candidate can have a comfortable conversation with everyone present in the room.<br />
	14.&nbsp; There must be a proper introduction of all members of the interview panel and the candidate.<br />
	15. The interviewer must try to keep the conversation straight and structured.<br />
	16. Body language must be relaxed.<br />
	17.&nbsp; Form an agenda.<br />
	18. Discuss the duties and responsibilities involved in the job<br />
	19. Determine the total time that can take place.<br />
	20. Provide the complete Job description of the role and responsibilities of the job to the Candidate.<br />
	21. Collect information - the structured questions must be put to the candidate so that all relevant information can be obtained.<br />
	22.&nbsp; However some flexibility is required in case some questions arise due to some flexibility in the conversation.<br />
	23. Try to get both the positive and negative aspects of the candidate and try to match the requirements.<br />
	24.&nbsp; Reserve some time for discussion on general topics.&nbsp;<br />
	25. Try to have a discussion on additional skills that candidates possess that have yet not been discussed.</p>
