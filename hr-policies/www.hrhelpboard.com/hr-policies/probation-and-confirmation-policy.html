<h1>A Brief about - Probation and Confirmation Policy</h1>

<hr />
<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">The probation and confirmation policy provides information about the terms and condition that a new employee should follow during probation period. The policy conveys that probation period is an opportunity to both new employee and their manager to do get adjusted and to improve the&nbsp;</span><u><strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/performance-management/job-performance-standards.html" title="performance"><span xss="removed">performance</span></a></strong></u><span xss="removed">.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span xss="removed">The probation period is a duration in which the performance and behavior of the newly hired employee is monitored by his or her manager in order to check their potential as well as their suitability to the job. The probation and confirmation policy clearly stated that a new employee should meet the set standard performance, should follow the code of conduct of the organization and behave in an acceptable manner. Some organization has 3 months of probation testing while others follow 6 months or 1 year of probation period. The probation examination period is also considered as an extension of selection process. The probation process begins with </span><u xss="removed"><strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/contract-letters/letter-of-appointment.html" title="appointment"><span xss="removed">appointment</span></a></strong></u><span xss="removed"> and later stages include job allocation, completion of probation period and review of performance. If the employee meets the expectation of organization in terms of performance then confirmation letter is provided to the employee. The reporting manager and HR department plays important role throughout the critical examination and evaluation&nbsp;period. In case the employee fails to reach the standard performance during probation period the organization has a right to terminate the employee.The cases such as maternity or paternity leave and non-recurring illness the organization should consider the extension of probation period on the prerequisite that both the party agree with the extension.</span></p>

<h2 xss="removed">Guidelines for Probation and confirmation Policy</h2>

<div xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">The guidelines are provided in the probation and confirmation policy for such cases and training efforts are suggested to be taken before termination of the employee. The employment probation and extension rules are as follow-</span></span></span></div>

Here, the employer is not aware of the exact performance the candidate will provide after joining. Also, there is an ambiguity about whether the candidate will be right fit in as the employee of the organization. Thus, by assigning probation, the organization checks the performance of the newly joined employee and ensures their integration in the organization. The probationary process provides an opportunity for the employer to verify the suitability of the employee for the assigned job and then take an appropriate decision about retention or </span></span><u><span xss="removed"><strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/contract-letters/termination-letter.html" title="termination of the employee"><span xss="removed">termination of the employee</span></a></strong></span><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">.</span></span></u></span></p>

<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">The probationary process is underpinned by effectiveness, equity, and accountability.

If the employee completes the employment probation period with satisfactory performance then employment confirmation will be provided by the organization. The probation period varies from 3 months to 1 year based on the type of organization and the industry. Transfer to another branch/city/country is prohibited during the employment probation period.</span></span></span></p>

Innovation in terms of lower the anxiety and uncertainty in the environment is a way to make the new employee feel comfortable in the organization. Such project is run by Infosys which is termed as &lsquo;Buddy&rsquo;. Here, apart from manager, another senior team member has given responsibility to help in adjustment of new employee in probation period. The team member will help new employees to understand the terms and conditions of the probation period and support them to improve their performance. In this way it will be easy for new employee to successfully complete the probation period and </span><strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/contract-letters/confirmation-letter.html" title="receive confirmation letter"><span xss="removed">receive confirmation letter</span></a></strong><span xss="removed">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">Another innovative practice is carried out in various universities. In the academic area it is difficult to start teaching the student on the very first day on joining. During probation period the new employee are worried about the way student will react and how they will rate their teaching. Thus, during probation period some universities allow the new employee joined on the junior level to attend the class of a senior employee. In this way the employee can take notes about how to handle the class and can observer the students reaction. At the end of the session the senior employee introduce the new employee to the students and thus provide a happy starting to their career. This is a best innovative way to reduce the anxiety, provide clarity about work profile and help the new employee to complete the probation period in satisfactory manner.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
